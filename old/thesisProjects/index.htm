<h2>Thesis project topics.</h2>
<p> Below I list some research ideas that I would like to supervise for a
research project/thesis. These can also be seen as research directions that I'm
interested in, so if you are interested in related projects feel free to contact me
as well (robv@itu.dk).</p>

<h3>Learn from context</h3>
<p>Context is crucial for interpretation of language and thus also for many NLP
tasks; however most tasks are tackled on the sentence level. A simple method
for incorporating context is to simply add the previous sentence, previous work
(e.g. <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2022.wnut-1.20.pdf">Vielsted et al.</a>) has
shown huge improvements with this. A more efficient and extendable method could 
be to include sentence embeddings in the first position(s), a variety of context size
can then be easily be incorporated.</p>

<h3>How to learn from different sources</h3>
<p>When training an NLP model on a variety of datasets, from different sources (and with different underlying distributions), it could be informative for the model to know about the origin of the text. A variety of methods can be used to inorporate this information, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Dataset embeddings: <a href="https://aclanthology.org/Q16-1031.pdf">Many Languages, One Parser</a></li>
    <li>Just include the domain as a special start token, like [SOCIAL] or [NEWS].</li>
    <li>Let the model predict the origin of the input as auxiliary task.</li>
</ul>

<p>These methods have shown promising results in isolated setups, but have never been consistently compared.</p>

<h3>Discriminative multi-task learning with seq2seq models</h3>
<p>In multi-task NLP, we commonly make the decision to use a discriminative
language model OR a generative language model. It is non-trivial to use a
discriminative model for generation, but the other way around is relatively
simple.  We could take the output after encoding (or even after decoding for
some tasks), and learn our classifier on top of this. </p>

<p>MaChAmp 0.1 had the option for seq2seq tasks with discriminative models: <a
href="https://aclanthology.org/2021.eacl-demos.22.pdf">Massive Choice, Ample
Tasks (MaChAmp):A Toolkit for Multi-task Learning in NLP</a>. In newer versions
this was removed, and generative language models are now supported (just
without the seq2seq task). Note that this project does not have to be
implemented within the MaChAmp framework.</p>



<h3>Processing of long documents</h3>
<p>Recent NLP models often have a maximum input size of 512 for efficiecny reasons. In a recent competition on predicting document similarity, the winning approach took the first and last 128 (sub)words of two documents to compare them. This means that the majority of the input data is not taken into account, which is probably suboptimal for performance. To exploit current models, a two layered approach can be used; first we embed the full input in multiple windows, keeping one embedding out of each of the windows, then we run a separate neural network over the output of the previous steps, leading to a single label prediction. </p>

</ul>

<h3>The effect of translationese on slot and intent detection</h3>
<p>The tasks of slot and intent detection is a crucial component of digital assisnents. Intent detection aims to find the goal of an utterance, and slot detection finds relevant entities. An example of this task:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Add</th>
    <th>reminder </th>
<th>to </th>
<th>swim </th>
<th>at </th>
<th>11am </th>
<th>tomorrow</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th> </th>
<th> </th>
<th>B-TODO </th>
<th> </th>
<th>B-DATETIME </th>
<th>I-DATETIME</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Intent:</th>
<th>add-reminder</th>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Recently, two big multi-lingual datasets have been introduced (multiAtis, and xSID). However, these datasets consist of data translated from English. Translationese is known to be different from spontaneous language. This project aims to estimate the effect of this difference. By generating a small sample of native non-English data (for example Danish), and evaluating this against the xSID data.</p>

<p>Here you can find the xSID paper, and an investigation on translationese for machine translation evaluation:</p>

</ul>


<h3>Multi-lingual lexical normalization</h3>
<p>Lexical normalization is the task of converting social media language to its canonical equivalent. Most literature on this problem is only tackling this task for one language. But in 2021, MultiLexNorm was introduced; including normalization datasets for 13 language variants. A wide variety of models was evaluated on this new benchmark, however all of these trained a single model for each language. However, at least three of these models can be used in a multi-lingual or cross-lingual setup, which could enable more efficiency, performance and transfer to new language for which no annotated data is available.

</ul>


<h3>Dependency parsing of Danish social media data</h3>
<p>Dependency parsing is the task of finding the syntactic relations between words in a sentence. <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/14.pdf">Chapter 14</a> of the Speech and Language Processing book contains a nice introduction to this topic. Many different languages and domains have been covered by the recent <a href="https://universaldependencies.org/">Universal Dependencies project</a>. However, for language types not covered performance is generally lower. Recently, we have collected some non-canonical data samples: <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.coling-main.583.pdf">DaN+</a>, for which it is uncertain how well current methods would perform.</p>

<p>The goal of this project would be to annotate a small sample of Danish social media data to evaluate parsers. Then, a variety of approaches of adapting the parser could be studied, including the ones mentioned below:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h3>Active learning for POS tagging</h3>
<p>POS tagging is the task of classifying words into their syntactic category:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>I</th>
    <th>see </th>
    <th>the</th>
    <th>light</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PRON</td>
    <td>VERB</td>
    <td>DET</td>
    <td>NOUN</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Current POS tagger are usually supervised, which means they rely on human-annotated training data. This data commonly exists of thousands of sentences. To make this process less costly, one can select a more informative sample of words to rely on, and instead only annotate this subsample. Previous work (see below) has shown that competetive performance can be obtained with as little as 400 words on English news data. However, it is unclear how this transfers to other languages/domains. In this project, the first step is to evaluate the existing method on a larger sample (i.e. the <a href="https://universaldependencies.org/">Universal Dependencies dataset</a>), followed by possible improvements to the model.</p>

<h3>Conversion of NLP tasks to sequence labeling tasks</h3>
<p>Because of the continually increasing power of sequence labelers,
competetive performance for complex tasks can be gained by simplifying tasks to
sequence labeling problems. This lead to efficient and accurate NLP models. The
main setup is: 1) find a task (I have a couple in mind already of course),
2) convert this a sequence labeling problem 3) train a sequence labeler for this
conversion, 4) then convert the sequence back to the original task and
evaluate. This is mainly an algorithmic project, as existing sequence labelers can be used.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Tokenization of social media data</h3>
<p>In many NLP benchmarks, tokenized texts are assumed as input to our models. For standard domains, tokenization can be considered a solved problem, however, for social media text tokenization is non-trivial. The goal of this project is to create a multi-lingual corpus and model for this task. Steps include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Finding the original utterances of <a href="http://noisy-text.github.io/2021/multi-lexnorm.html">Multi-LexNorm</a></li>
    <li>Create a gold standard dataset based on the original and the tokenized data.</li>
    <li>Evaluate existing tokenizers and train your own.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Efficient Language identification for many languages</h3>

<p>Language identification is a standard NLP task, which is often considered to be solved. However, most current classifiers only support around 100 languages, or are not publicly available. This project makes use of the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ralf/langid.html">LTI LangID Corpus</a>(with &#62;1300 languages), and asks the question: how can we efficiently handle such a large label space, and such a wide variety in input-features. Relevant previous work:</p>

<h3>Strategies for Morphological Tagging</h3>
<p>Morphological tagging is the task of assigning labels to a sequence of tokens that describe them morphologically.  
This means that one word can have 0-n labels. There has been a variety of architectures proposed to solve this task, 
however it is unclear which method works best in which situation. </p>

<p>In this project you can make use of the <a
href="https://universaldependencies.org/">Universal Dependencies</a> data,
which has annotation for morphological tags for many languages. You can use the
<a href="https://machamp-nlp.github.io/">MaChAmp</a> toolkit, or implement a
BiLSTM tagger yourself, and evaluate at least the three most common
strategies:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Predict the concatenation of the tags as one label (same as POS tagging, but with more labels)</li>
    <li>Predict morphological tags as a sequence (like machine translation)</li>
    <li>View the task as a multilabel prediction problem (Get a probability for each label, and set a cutoff threshold)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Effect of sociodemographic factors on language use</h3>
<p>Recent work has shown that including the origin of a text instance can improve
performance on NLP tasks. However, it is unclear which specific sociodemographic
attributes correlate with language use. Recent efforts on annotation of social
media data could give us more insights.</p>
