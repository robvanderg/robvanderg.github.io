GroRef: Rule-Based Coreference Resolution for Dutch

We have adapted Stanfordâ€™s multi-pass sieve coreference resolution system for
Dutch. Our experiments prove that this rule-based system works robustly on
Dutch, for different domains. Because no training data is needed, it is a
well-suited approach for low-resource languages.
