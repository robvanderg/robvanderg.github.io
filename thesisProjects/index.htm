<h3>Active learning for POS tagging</h3>
<p>POS tagging is the task of classifying words into their syntactic category:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>I</th>
    <th>see </th>
    <th>the</th>
    <th>light</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PRON</td>
    <td>VERB</td>
    <td>DET</td>
    <td>NOUN</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Current POS tagger are usually supervised, which means they rely on human-annotated training data. This data commonly exists of thousands of sentences. To make this process less costly, one can select a more informative sample of words to rely on, and instead only annotate this subsample. Previous work (see below) has shown that competetive performance can be obtained with as little as 400 words on English news data. However, it is unclear how this transfers to other languages/domains. In this project, the first step is to evaluate the existing method on a larger sample (i.e. the <a href="https://universaldependencies.org/">Universal Dependencies dataset</a>), followed by possible improvements to the model.</p>

<h3>Unsupervised code-switch detection</h3>
<p>Code-switching is the phenomenon of switching to another language within one utterance. Many previous approaches have been evaluated for a variety of language pairs; however, they are all trained on annotated code-switched data.</p>

<p>To increase the usefulness of such a code-switch detector, the idea is to train a system based on two monolingual datasets to predict language labels on the word level. An example of the desired output is shown below:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>@friend</th>
    <th>u </th>
    <th>perform</th>
    <th>besop</th>
    <th>apa</th>
    <th>tudey</th>
    <th>?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>un</td>
    <td>en</td>
    <td>en</td>
    <td>id</td>
    <td>id</td>
    <td>en</td>
    <td>?</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Conversion of NLP tasks to sequence labeling tasks</h3>
<p>Because of the continually increasing power of sequence labelers,
competetive performance for complex tasks can be gained by simplifying tasks to
sequence labeling problems. This lead to efficient and accurate NLP models. The
main setup is: 1) find a task (I have a couple in mind already of course),
2) convert this a sequence labeling problem 3) train a sequence labeler for this
conversion, 4) then convert the sequence back to the original task and
evaluate. This is mainly an algorithmic project, as existing sequence labelers can be used.</p>

<h3>Dialogue acts classification for social media data</h3>
<p>Dialogue acts classify the intended goal of a textual utterance. Dialogue acts have mostly been studied in the context of telephone conversations. However, when sharing utterances on social media, people generally also have an intended goal (perhaps not always, so a MISC column should be considered).</p>

<p>Some resources on Dialogue Acts:</p>

</ul>

<h3>Effect of sociodemographic factors on language use</h3>
Recent work has shown that including the origin of a text instance can improve
performance on NLP tasks. However, it is unclear which specific sociodemographic
attributes correlate with language use. Recent efforts on annotation of social
media data could give us more insights.

<!--<h3>Annotation tool for standard NLP formats</h3>
In NLP tab-seperated files are commonly used (like in the 
<a href="https://universaldependencies.org/">UD data</a>).
To get the ground truth for which we can train machine learning models, we
first let humans annotate data. Many annotation tools exist for NLP tasks;
however, most of them use their own data formats. Furthermore, changing the
original text (for example to seperate words from punctuation) is generally not
supported.  Because of this, it is cumbersome to use these tools, as you have
to keep converting the data.  Novelties for this tool would be:

<img src="../pics/annotation.jpg" style="float: right; margin-right: 1%; margin-top:50px; width:300px;" alt="me" >

<ul>
    <li>Browser-based</li>
    <li>Directly use exising NLP standard formats</li>
    <li>Visualize the annotation and the raw text file simultaneously</li>
    <li>Support for span-label annotation and sentence level classification (other tasks can be included later)</li>
    <li>Support left-to-right languages</li>
    <li>(It could even include a prediction model to save time for the annotators)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Machine translation of social media data</h3>
<p>While performance of machine translation keeps increasing, the current models do not perform well on non-standard (i.e. social media) text. One solution to this problem would be to transform this data a `normal' form (e.g. by using <a href="http://www.robvandergoot.com/monoise">MoNoise</a>) before translating it.</p>

<h3>Low-resource dependency parsing</h3>
<p>Dependency parsing is the task of finding the syntactic relations between words in a sentence. For more information I refer to the <a href="https://universaldependencies.org/">UD page</a>, which contains data annotated for this task for over 70 languages. </p>

<p>Very high scores have been obtained for this task (&gt; 95%), however this is all done by supervised parsers, which are trained on large amounts of annotated data. I am generally interested in doing natural language processing for less-resourced situations (languages/domains). Yes, this topic is less concrete as the previous one, contact me for more concrete ideas. Some interesting recent work:</p>

<h3>Contextualized representations for word graphs</h3>
<p><b>Be aware, this is a complex topic</b></p>
<p>Use of contextualized embeddings (e.g. BERT) for word graphs. This can be used in multiple cases:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Simplified (number of nodes are known): <a href="">http://robvandergoot.com/doc/acl17.pdf</a></li>
    <li>Could also be more advanced, when parsing full word-graphs. Then insertion/deletion/splitting of words can be included.</li>
</ul>
