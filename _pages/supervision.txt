The following list describes how Rob normally supervises, if you would like 
to deviate, please request this before the project starts.

- The Proposal/agreement should be between 1 paragraph and 1 page in length,
  the word “analysis” has to be in there.
- I have 30 minutes of time per week available for each project. You can choose
  if you want to once every week, or have longer meetings once every two weeks.
- Rob's working times are often 07:00-15:00 
- If you e-mail a draft one week before the deadline, you can get a full round
  of feedback on the writing. 
- There are no rules about the numbers of pages. In general, most projects end
  up between 4-10 pages with the ACL style files
  (https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files ). 
- Target audience: your co-students. 
- Rob will not give you deadlines; this is your project. 
- For background reading I strongly recommend: https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/ 
- In NLP almost all our papers are available for free on
  https://aclanthology.org/ . The highest quality is usually found in the *CL
  conferences and EMNLP. Note that you should also use the citations (.bib files)
  from here. 
- Rob tries to answer e-mails within 2 working days, if that does not happen he
  will e-mail that it takes longer. If he doesn't, he likely missed the e-mail
  somehow; please send a reminder. 
- We have a collection of good NLP projects done at ITU, Rob can share this folder
  with you
- There is a bachelors course “NLP and Deep Learning” in the spring, and a
  masters course “Advanced NLP” in the fall. If you are not a data science
  student, you can of course join any of the lectures there if they are
  interesting/relevant for you. Ask Rob for the latest schedules if you are
  interested in this. 
- The above mentioened courses are occasionally recorded, Rob can share these
  recording.
- If you want Rob to prepare something for the meeting, e-mail him in advance
